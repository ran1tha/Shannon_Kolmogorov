# Shannon_Kolmogorov

Shannon entropy, named after mathematician Claude Shannon, was introduced in his 1948 paper ”A Mathematical Theory of Communication”[1].
The concept of Shannon entropy has found diverse applications across
various fields, such as computer science, data analysis, cryptography, and
machine learning. Kolmogorov complexity, named after mathematician
Andrey Kolmogorov, is a concept from algorithmic information theory.
In this short article a brief introduction to both these concepts are given.
Finally, the relationship between Shannon entropy and expected Kolmogorov complexity is explained.
